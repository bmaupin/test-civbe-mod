-- Jon wanted a lot of changes to terrain composition for Civ5. These have
-- had the effect of making different parts of each randomly generated map
-- more distinct, more unique, but it has also necessitated a complete
-- overhaul of where civs are placed on the map and how resources are
-- distributed. The new placements are much more precise, both for civs 
-- and resources. As such, any modifications to terrain or resource types 
-- will no longer be "plug and play" in the XML. Terrain modders will have 
-- to work with this file as well as the XML, to integrate their mods in to
-- the new system.

-- Some civs will be purposely placed in difficult terrain, depending on what
-- a given map instance has to offer. Civs placed in tough environments will
-- receive specific amounts of assistance, primarily in the form of Bonus food
-- from Wheat, Cows, Deer, Bananas, or Fish. This part of the new system is 
-- very precisely calibrated and balanced, so be aware that any changes or 
-- additions to how resources are placed near start points will have a 
-- dramatic effect on the game, and could pose challenges of a sort that were
-- not present in the sphere of Civ4 modding.

-- The Luxury resources are also carefully calibrated. In a given game, some
-- will be clustered near a small number of civs (perhaps even a monopoly 
-- given to one). Some will be placed only near City States, requiring civs 
-- to go through a City State, one way or another, to obtain any instances of
-- that luxury type. Some will be left up to fate, appearing randomly in 
-- whatever is their normal habitat. Yet others may be oversupplied or perhaps
-- even absent from a given game. Which luxuries fall in to which category 
-- will be scrambled, to keep players guessing, and to help further the sense
-- of curiosity when exploring a new map in a new game.

-- WARNING: There must not be any recalculation of AreaIDs at any time during

function AssignStartingPlots:PlaceImpactAndRipples(x, y)
	-- This function operates upon the "impact and ripple" data overlays. This
	-- is the core version, which operates on start points. Resources and city 
	-- states have their own data layers, using this same design principle.
	-- Execution of this function handles a single start point (x, y).
	--[[ The purpose of the overlay is to strongly discourage placement of new
	     start points near already-placed start points. Each start placed makes
	     an "impact" on the map, and this impact "ripples" outward in rings, each
	     ring weaker in bias than the previous ring. ... Civ4 attempted to adjust
	     the minimum distance between civs according to a formula that factored
	     map size and number of civs in the game, but the formula was chock full 
	     of faulty assumptions, resulting in an accurate calibration rate of less
	     than ten percent. The failure of this approach is the primary reason 
	     that an all-new positioner was written for Civ5. ... Rather than repeat
	     the mistakes of the old system, in part or in whole, I have opted to go 
	     with a flat 9-tile impact crater for all map sizes and number of civs.
	     The new system will place civs at least 9 tiles away from other civs
	     whenever and wherever a reasonable candidate plot exists at this range. 
	     If a start must be found within that range, it will attempt to balance
	     quality of the location against proximity to another civ, with the bias
	     becoming very heavy inside 7 plots, and all but prohibitive inside 5.
	     The only starts that should see any Civs crowding together are those 
	     with impossible conditions such as cramming more than a dozen civs on 
	     to Tiny or Duel sized maps. ... The Impact and Ripple is aimed mostly
	     at assisting with Rectangular Method regional division on islands maps,
	     as the primary method of spacing civs is the Center Bias factor. The 
	     Impact and Ripple is a second layer of protection, for those rare cases
	     when regional shapes are severely distorted, with little to no land in
	     the region center, and the start having to be placed near the edge, and
	     for cases of extremely thin regional dimension.   ]]--

Notes for Civ:BE

1. Wild Areas (that are defined before starts are chosen) and canyon plots are ignored by regional division.

2. Start locations attempt to avoid any substantial patches of Wild Area, especially the "Core" plots.

3. Natural Wonders, City States, and Luxury resources are removed.

4. Stations were handled in here temporarily, but migrated to the game core later.

5. Firaxite, Float Stone and Xenomass are "Affinity" or "Key" strategic resources. They
are visible from game start but have no early game applications. Geothermal, 
Petroleum and Titanium are hidden at start but have early game applications. The
rest of the resources are "Basic" and primarily offer plot-yield improvement.

6. Most of the Key resources are specifically placed inside the "Wild Areas" where the aliens
and alien nests spawn the most intently. Civs will have to contend with the aliens, one way
or another, to obtain substantial quantities of these resources.

7. Structural changes were made in numerous areas and functions for resource distribution.

-- Reference Section from Civ5.

APPENDIX A - ORDER OF OPERATIONS

1. StartPlotSystem() is called from MapGenerator() in MapGenerator.lua

2. If left to default, StartPlotSystem() executes. However, since the core map
options (World Age, etc) are now custom-handled in each map script, nearly every
script needs to overwrite this function to process the Resources option. Many
scripts also need to pass in arguments, such as division method or bias adjustments.

3. AssignStartingPlots.Create() organizes the table that includes all member
functions and all common data.

4. AssignStartingPlots.Create() executes __Init() and __InitLuxuryWeights() to
populate data structures with values applicable to the current game and map. An
empty override is also provided via __CustomInit() to allow for easy modifications
on a small scale, instead of needing to replace all of the Create() function: for
instance, if a script wants to change only a couple of values in the self dot table.

5. AssignStartingPlots:DivideIntoRegions() is called. This function and its
children carry out the creation of Region Data, to be acted on by later methods.
-a. Division method is chosen by parameter. Default is Method 2, Continental.
-b. Four core methods are included. Refer to the function for details.
-c. If applicable, start locations are assigned to specific Areas (landmasses).
-d. Each populated landmass is processed. Any with more than one civ assigned 
to them are divided in to Regions. Any with one civ are designated as a Region.
If a Rectuangular method is chosen, the map is divided without regard to Areas.
-e. Regional division occurs based on "Start Placement Fertility" measurements,
which are hard-coded in the function that measures the worth of a given plot. To
change these values for a script or mod, override the applicable function.
-f. All methods generate a database of Regions. The data includes coordinates
of the southwest corner of the region, plus width and height. If width or 
height, counting from the SW corner, would exceed a map edge, world-wrap is 
implied. As such, all processes that act on Regions need to account for wrap.
Other data included are the AreaID of the region (-1 if a division method in
use that ignores Areas), the total Start Placement Fertility measured in that
region, the total plot count of the region's rectangle, and fertility/plot. (I 
was not told until later that no Y-Wrap support would be available. As such, 
the entire default system is wired for Y-Wrap support, which seems destined to 
lie dormant unless this code is re-used with Civ6 or some other game with Y-Wrap.)

6. AssignStartingPlots:ChooseLocations() is called.
-a. Each Region defined in self.regionData has its terrain types measured.
-b. Using the terrain types, each Region is classified. The classifications
should match the definitions in Regions.XML -- or Regions.xml needs to be 
altered to match the internal classifications of any modified process. The 
Regional classifications affect favored types of terrain for the start plot
selection in that Region, plus affect matching of start locations with those
civilizations who come with Terrain Bias (preferring certain conditions to 
support their specific abilities), as well as the pool from which the Region's
Luxury type will be selected.
-c. An order of processing for Regions is determined. Regions of lowest average
fertility get their start plots chosen first. When a start plot is selected, it
creates a zone around itself where any additional starts will be reluctant to
appear, so the order matters. We give those with the worst land the best pick
of the land they have, while those with the best land will be the ones (if any)
to suffer being "pushed around" by proximity to already-chosen start plots.
-d. Start plots are chosen. There is a method that forces starts to occur along
the oceans, another method that allows for inland placement, and a third method
that ignores AreaID and instead looks for the most fertile Area available.

7. AssignStartingPlots:BalanceAndAssign() is called.
-a. Each start plot is evaluated for land quality. Those not meeting playable
standards are modified via adding Bonus Resources, Oases, or Hills. Ice, if
any, is removed from the waters immediately surrounding the start plot.
-b. The civilizations active in the current game are checked for Terrain Bias.
Any civs with biases are given first pick of start locations, seeking their
particular type of bias. Then civs who have a bias against certain terrain
conditions are given pick of what is left. Finally, civs without bias are
randomly assigned to the remaining regions.
-c. If the game is a Team game, start locations may be exchanged in an effort
to ensure that teammates start near one another. (This may upset Biases).

8. AssignStartingPlots:PlaceNaturalWonders() is called.
-a. All plots on the map are evaluated for eligibility for each Natural
wonder. Map scripts can overwrite eligibility calculations for any given NW
type, where desired. Lists of candidate plots are assembled for each NW.
-b. Some NW's with stricter eligibility may be prioritized to always appear
when eligible. The number of NWs that are eligible is checked against the 
map. If the map can support more than the number allowed for that game (based
on map size), then the ones that will be placed are selected at random.
-c. The order of placement gives priority to any "always appear if eligible"
wonders, then priority after that goes to the wonder with the fewest candidates.
-d. There are minimum distance considerations for both civ starts and other
Natural Wonders, reflected in the Impact Data Layers. If collisions eliminate
all of a wonder's candidate plots, then a replacement wonder will be "pulled 
off the bench and put in the game", if such a replacement is available.

9. AssignStartingPlots:PlaceResourcesAndCityStates() is called.
-a. Luxury resources are assigned roles. Each Region draws from a weighted
pool of Luxury types applicable to its dominant terrain type. This process
occurs according to Region Type, with Type 1 (Tundra) going first. Where
multiple regions of the same type occur, those within each category are
randomized in the selection order. When all regions have been matched to a
Luxury type (and each Luxury type can be spread across up to three regions)
then the City States pick three of the remaining types, at random. The
number of types to be disabled for that map size are removed, then the 
remainder are assigned to be distributed globally, at random. Note that all
of these values are subject to modification. See Great Plains, for example.
-b. City States are assigned roles. If enough of them (1.35x civ count, at 
least), then one will be assigned to each region. If the CS count way
exceeds the civ count, multiple CS may be assigned per region. Of those
not assigned to a region off the bat, the land of the map must be evaluated
to determine how much land exists outside of any region (if any). City
States get assigned to these "Uninhabited" lands next. Then we check for
any Luxuries that got split three-ways (a misfortune for those regions)
and, if there are enough unassigned CS remaining to give each such region
a bonus CS, this is done. Any remaining CS are awarded to Regions with the
lowest average fertility per land plot (and bound to have more total land
around as a result).
-c. The city state locations are chosen. Two methods exist: regional
placement, which strongly favors the edges of regions (civ starts strongly
favor the center of regions), and Uninhabited, which are completely random.
-d. Any city states that were unable to be placed where they were slated to 
go (due to proximity collisions, aka "overcrowded area", then are moved to 
a "last chance" fallback list and will be squeezed in anywhere on the map 
that they can fit. If even that fails, the city state is discarded.
-e. Luxury resources are placed. Each civ gets at least one at its start
location. Regions of low fertility can get up to two more at their starts.
Then each city state gets one luxury, the type depending on what is 
possible to place at their territory, crossed with the pool of types
available to city states in that game. Then, affected by what has already
been placed on the map, the amount of luxuries for each given region are
determined and placed. Finally, based on what has been placed so far, the
amount of the remaining types is determined, and they are placed globally.
-f. Each civ is given a second Luxury type at its start plot (except in 
games using the Resources core map option available on most scripts, and
choosing the Sparse setting.) This second Luxury type CAN be Marble, which
boosts wonder production. (Marble is not in the normal rotation, though.)
-g. City State locations low on food (typical) or hammers get some help
in the normalization process: mostly food Bonus resources.
-h. Strategic resources are placed globally. The terrain balance greatly
affects location and quantity of various types and their balance. So the
game is going to play differently on different map scripts.
-i. Bonus resources are distributed randomly, with weightings. (Poor 
terrain types get more assistance, particularly the Tundra. Hills regions
get extra Bonus support as well.)
-j. Various cleanup operations occur, including placing petroleum in the sea, 
fixing Sugar terrain -- and as the very last item, recalculating Area IDs, 
which invalidates the entire Region Data pool, so it MUST come last.

10. Process ends. Map generation continues according to MapGenerator()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

APPENDIX B - ADVICE FOR MODDERS

Depending upon the game areas being modified, it may be necessary to modify
the start placement and resource distribution code to support your effort.

-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --
If you are modifying Civilizations:

* You can plug your new or modified civilizations in to the Terrain Bias 
system via table entries in Civ5Civilizations.xml

1. Start Along Ocean
2. Start Along River		-- Ended up inactive for the initial civ pool, but is operational in the code.
3. Start Region Priority
4. Start Region Avoid

Along Ocean is boolean, defaulting to false, and is processed first, 
overriding all other concerns. Along River is boolean and comes next.

Priority and Avoid refer to "region types", of which there are eight. Each 
of these region types is dominated by the associated terrain.
1. Tundra
2. Jungle
3. Forest
4. Desert
5. Hills
6. Plains
7. Grass
8. Hybrid (of plains and grass).

The defintions are sequential, so that a region that might qualify for
more than one designation gets the lowest-number it qualifies for.

The Priority and Avoid can be multiple-case. There are multiple-case Avoid
needs in the initial Civ pool, but only single-case Priority needs. This is
because the single-case needs have a fallback method that will place the civ
in the region with the most of its favored terrain type, if no region is 
available that is dominated by that terrain. Whereas any Civ that has multiple
Priority needs must find an exact region match to one of its needs or it gets
no bias. Thus I found that all of the biases desired for the initial Civ pool
were able to be met via single Priority.

Any clash between Priority and Avoid, Priority wins. 

I hope you enjoy this new ability to flavor and influence start locations.

If you are modifying Resources:

XML no longer plays any role whatsoever on the distribution of Resources, but
it does still define available resource types and how they will interact with
the game.

Do not place a Luxury resource type at the top of the list, in ID slot #0.
Other than that, you can do what you will with the list and how they are ordered.

Be warned, there is NO automatic handling of resource balance and appearance for
new or modified resource types. Gone is the Civ4 method of XML-based terrain
permissions. Gone is plug-and-play with new resource types. If you remove any
types from the list, you will need to disable the hard-coded handling of those
types present in the resource distribution. If you modify or add types, you will
not see them in the game until you add them to the hard-coded distribution.

The distribution is handled wholly within this file, here in Lua. Whether you 
approve of this change is your prerogative, but it does come with benefits in
the form of greatly increased power over how the resources are placed.

Bonus resources are used as the primary method for start point balancing, both
for civs and city states. Bonus Resources do nothing at all other than affect
yields of an individual tile and the type of improvement needed in that tile.

If you modify or add bonus resources, you may want to modify Normalization
methods as well, so your mod interacts with this subsystem. These are the 
methods involved with Bonus resource normalization:

AttemptToPlaceBonusResourceAtPlot()
AttemptToPlaceHillsAtPlot()
AttemptToPlaceSmallStrategicAtPlot()
NormalizeStartLocation()
NormalizeCityState()
NormalizeCityStateLocations()	-- Dependent on PlaceLuxuries being executed first.
AddExtraBonusesToHillsRegions()

Strategic Resources are now quantified, so their placement is no longer of the
nature of on/off, and having extra of something may help. Strategics are no longer
a significant part of the trading system. As such, their balance is looser in
Civ5 than it had to be in Civ4 or Civ3. Strategics are now placed globally, but
you can modify this to any method you choose. The default method is here:

PlaceStrategicAndBonusResources()

And it primarily relies upon the per-tile approach of this method:

ProcessResourceList()

Bonus resources are the same, for their global distribution. Additional functions
that provide custom handling are here:

AddStrategicBalanceResources()	-- Only called when this game launch option is in effect.
PlaceSmallQuantitiesOfStrategics()
PlaceFish()
PlaceSexyBonusAtCivStarts()
PlaceOilInTheSea()
FixSugarJungles()

All three types of Resources, which each play a different role in the game, are
dependent upon the new "Impact and Ripple" data layers to detect previously
placed instances and remain at appropriate distances. By replacing a singular,
hardcoded "minimum distance" with the impact-and-ripple, I have been able to
introduce variable distances. This creates a less contrived-looking result and
allows for some clustering of resources without letting the clusters grow too 
large, and without predetermining the nature and distribution of clusters. You
can most easily understand the net effect of this change by examing the fish
distribution. You will see that is less regular than the Civ4 method, yet still
avoids packing too many fish in to any given area. Larger clusters are possible
but quite rare, and the added variance should make city placement more interesting.

Another benefit of the Impact and Ripple is that it is Hex Accurate. The ripples
form a true hexagon (radiating outward from the impact plot, with weightings and
biases weakening the farther away from the impact it sits) instead of a rectangle
defined by an x-y coordinate area scan.

What this means for you, as a Resources modder, is that you will need to grasp
the operation of Impact and Ripple in order to properly calibrate any placements
of resources that you decide to make. This is true for all three types. Each has
its own layer of Impact and Ripple, but you could choose to remove a resource 
from participation in a given layer, assign it to a different layer or to its own
layer, or even discard this method and come up with your own. Realize that each
resource placed will impact its layer, rippling outward from its plot to whatever
radius range you have selected, and then bar any later placements from being close
to that resource.

Everywhere in this code that a civ start is placed, or a city state, or a resource,
there are associated Impacts and Ripples on one or more data layers. The 
interaction of all this activity is why a common database was needed. Yet because
none of this data affects the game after game launch and the map has been set, it 
is all handled locally here in Lua, then is discarded and its memory recycled.

Meanwhile, Luxury resources are more tightly controlled than ever. The Regional
Division methods are as close to fair as I could make them, considering the highly
varied and unpredicatable landforms generated by the various map scripts. They
are fair enough to form a basis for distributing Luxuries in a way to create
supply and demand, to foster trade and diplomacy.


All Luxury resource placements are handled via this method:

PlaceSpecificNumberOfResources()

This method also handles placement of sea-based sources of petroleum.


Like ProcessResourceList(), this method acts upon a plot list fed to it, but 
instead of handling large numbers of plots and placing one for every n plots, it
tends to handle much smaller number of plots, and will return the number it was
unable to place for whatever reason (collisions with the luxury data layer being
the main cause, and not enough members in the plot list to receive all the
resources being placed is another) so that fallback methods can try again.

As I mentioned earlier, XML no longer governs resource placement. Gone are the 
XML terrain permissions, a hardwired "all or nothing" approach that could allow
a resource to appear in forest (any forest), or not. The new method allows for 
more subtlety, such as creating a plot list that includes only forests on hills,
or which can allow a resource to appear along rivers in the plains but only 
away from rivers in grasslands. The sky is the limit, now, when it comes to 
customizing resource appearance. Any method you can measure and implement, and
translate in to a list of candidate plots, you can apply here.

The default permissions are now contained in an interaction between two married
functions: terrain-based plot lists and a function matching each given resource
to a selection of lists appropriate to that resource.

The three list-generating functions are these:

GenerateGlobalResourcePlotLists()
GenerateLuxuryPlotListsAtCitySite()
GenerateLuxuryPlotListsInRegion()


The indexing function is:

GetIndicesForLuxuryType()


The process uses one of these three list generations (depending on whether it 
is currently trying to assign Luxuries globally, regionally, or in support of
a specific civ or city state start location).

Other methods determine WHICH Luxury fits which role and how much of it to place;
then these processes come up with candidate plot lists, and then the indexing
matches the appropriate lists to the specific luxury type. Finally, all of this
data is passed to the function that actually places the Luxury, which is:

PlaceSpecificNumberOfResources()


If you want to modify the terrain permissions of existing Luxury types, you 
need only handle the list generators and the indexing function.


If you want to modify which Luxury types get assigned to which Region types:

__InitLuxuryWeights()
IdentifyRegionsOfThisType()
SortRegionsByType()
AssignLuxuryToRegion()

All weightings for regional matching are contained here. But beware, the
system has to handle up to 22 civilizations and 41 city states, so the 
combination of self.iNumMaxAllowedForRegions and the number of regions to
which any given Luxury can be assigned must multiply out to more than 22.

The default system allows up to 8 types for regions, up to 3 regions per type,
factoring out to 24 maximum allowable, barely enough to cover 22 civs.

Perhaps in an Expansion pack, more Luxury types could be added, to ease the
stress on the system. As it is, I had to spend a lot of political capital 
with Jon to get us to Fifteen Luxury Types, and have enough to make this
new concept and this new system work. The amount is plenty for the default
numbers of civs for each map size, though. If too many types come available
in a given game, it could upset the game balance regarding Health and Trade.


If you wish to add new Luxury types, there is quite a bit involved. You will 
either have to plug your modifications in to the existing system, or replace
the entire system. I have worked to make it as easy as possible to interact
with the new system, documenting every function, every design element. And
since this entire system exists here in Lua, nothing is beyond your reach.

The "handy resource ID shortcuts" will free you from needing to order the
luxuries in the XML in any particular fashion. These IDs will adapt to the
XML list. But you will have to create new shortcuts for any added or renamed
Luxury types, and activate the shortcuts here:

__Init()

You will also need to deactivate or remove any code handling luxury types
that your mod removes. I recommend using an editor with a Find feature and 
scan the file for all instances of keys that you want to remove. At each
instance found, if the key is in a group, you can safely remove it from 
the group so long as the group retains at least one key in it. If the key
is the only one being acted upon, you may need to replace it with a different
key or else deactivate that chunk of code. (If the method attempts to act
upon a nil-value key, that will cause an Assert and the start finder will
exit without finishing all of its operations.)

If you are going to plug in to the new system, you need to determine if the
default terrain-based plot lists meet your needs. If not, create new list 
types for all three list-generation methods and index them as applicable.

GenerateGlobalResourcePlotLists()
GenerateLuxuryPlotListsAtCitySite()
GenerateLuxuryPlotListsInRegion()
GetIndicesForLuxuryType()

You will also need to modify functions that determine which Luxury types
can be placed at City States (this affects which luxury each receives).

GetListOfAllowableLuxuriesAtCitySite()


Finally, the command center of Luxury Distribution is here:

PlaceLuxuries()

If you are modifying Terrain:

You will need to update every aspect of the new system to make it operate
correctly on your terrain changes. Or you will need to replace the entire system.

I'm sorry if that is bad news, but if you modified Terrain for Civ4, you likely
experienced it being applied inconsistently (not working on lots of map scripts)
and ran in to barriers where something you wanted to do was impossible, because
only certain limited permissions were enabled through the XML. You may even have
had to rise to the level of modifying the game core DLLs in C++ to open up more
functionality.

Whatever interactions with the game core your terrain needs to make remain in the
XML and the C++. The only relevant aspects here involve how your terrain interacts
with map generation, start placement, and resource distribution.

I have modified the base map generation methods to include more parameters and
options, so that more of the map scripts can rely on them. This means less 
hardcoding in individual scripts, to where an update to the core methods that 
includes new terrain types or feature types will have a wider reach.

As for start placement and resources, a big part of Jon's vision for Civ5 was to
bring back grandiose terrain, realistically large regions of Desert, Tundra, 
Plains, and so on. But this type of map, combined with the old start generation
method, tended to force starts on grassland, and do other things counter to the
vision. So I designed the new system to more accurately divide the map, not by 
strict tile count, but by relative worth, trying to give each civ as fair a patch
of land as possible. Where the terrain would be too harsh, we would support it
with Bonus resources, which could now be placed in any quantity needed, thanks to
being untied from the trade system. The regonal division divides the map, then
the classification system identifies each region's dominant terrain type and aims
to give the civ who starts there a flavored environment, complete with a start in
or near that type of terrain, enough Bonus to remove the worst cases of "bad luck", 
and a cluster of luxury resources at hand that is appropriate to that region type.

In doing all of this, I have hard-coded the system with countless assumptions 
based on the default terrain. If you wish to make use of this system in tandem 
with new types of terrain or with modified yields of existing terrain, or both,
you will need to rewire the system, mold it to the specific needs of the new
terrain balance that you are crafting.

This begins with the Start Placement Fertility, which is measured per plot here:

MeasureStartPlacementFertilityOfPlot()


Measurements are processed in two ways, but you likely don't need to mod these:

MeasureStartPlacementFertilityInRectangle()
MeasureStartPlacementFertilityOfLandmass()


Once you have regions dividing in ways appropriate to your new terrain, you will
need to update terrain measurements and regional classifications here:

MeasureTerrainInRegions()
DetermineRegionTypes()

You may also have XML work to do in regard to regions. The region list is here:
CIV5Regions.xml

And each Civilization's specific regional or terrain bias is found here:
CIV5Civilizations.xml


Start plot location is a rather sizable operation, spanning half a dozen functions.

MeasureSinglePlot()
EvaluateCandidatePlot()
IterateThroughCandidatePlotList()
FindStart()
FindCoastalStart()
FindStartWithoutRegardToAreaID()
ChooseLocations()

Depending on the nature of your modifications, you may need to recalibrate this 
entire system. However, like with Start Fertility, the core of the system is 
handled at the plot level, evaluating the meaning of each type of plot for each
type of region. I have enacted a simple mechanism at the core, with only four
categories of plot measurement: Food, Prod, Good, Junk. The food label may be
misleading, as this is the primary mechanism for biasing starting terrain. For
instance, in tundra regions I have tundra tiles set as Food, but grass are not.
A desert region sets Plains as Food but Grass is not, while a Jungle region sets
Grass as Food but Plains aren't. The Good tiles act as a hedge, and are the main
way of differentiating one candidate site from another, so that among a group of
plots of similar terrain, the best tends to get picked. I also have the overall
standards set reasonably low to keep the Center Bias element of the system at 
the forefront of start placement. This is chiefly because the exact quality of 
the initial starting location is less urgent than maintaining as good of a 
positioning as possible among civs. Balancing the quality of the start plot
against positioning near the center of each region was a fun challenge to 
tackle, and I feel that I have succeeded in my design goals. Just be aware that
any change loosening the bias toward the center could ripple through the system.

Regional terrain biases that purposely put starts in non-ideal terrain are
intended to be supported via Normalization and other compensations built in to
the system in general. Yet the normalization used in Civ5 is much more lightly
applied than Civ4's methods. The new system modifies the actual terrain as
little as possible, giving support mostly through the addition of Bonus type
resources, which add food. Jon wanted starts to occur in a variety of terrain
yet for each to be competitive. He directed me to use resources to balance it.


If your terrain modifications affect tile yields, or introduce new elements in
to the ecosystem, it is likely your mod would benefit from adjusting the start
site normalization process.

AttemptToPlaceBonusResourceAtPlot()
AttemptToPlaceHillsAtPlot()
AttemptToPlaceSmallStrategicAtPlot()
NormalizeStartLocation()
PlaceSexyBonusAtCivStarts()
AddExtraBonusesToHillsRegions()

City State placement is subordinate to civ placement, in the new system. The 
city states get no consideration whatsoever to the quality of their starts, only
to the location relative to civilizations. So this is the one area of the system
that is likely to be unaffected by terrain mods, except at Normalization:

NormalizeCityState()
NormalizeCityStateLocations()


Finally, a terrain mod is sure to scramble the hard-coded and carefully balanced
resource distribution system. That entire system is predicated upon the nature
of default terrain, what it yields, how the pieces interact, how they are placed
by map scripts, and in general governed by a measured sense of realism, informed
by gameplay needs and a drive for simplicity. From the order of operations upon
regions (sorted by dominant terrain type) to the interwoven nature of resource
terrain preferences, it is unlikely the default implementation will properly 
support any significant terrain mod. The work needed to integrate a terrain mod
in to resource distribution would be similar to that needed for a resource mod,
so I will refer you back to that section of the appendix for additional info.

If you are modifying game rules:

The new system is rife with dependencies upon elements in the default rules. This
need not be a barrier to your mod, but it will surely assist in your cause to
be alert to possible side effects of game rules changes. One of the biggest
dependencies lies with rules that govern tile improvements: how much they benefit,
where they are possible to build, when upgrades to their yield output come online
and so forth. Evaluations for Fertility that governs regional division, for 
Normalization that props up weaker locations, and the logic of resource distribution
(such as placing numerous Deer in the tundra to make small cities viable there)
all depend in large part on the current game rules. So if, for instance, your mod
were to remove or push back the activation of yield boost at Fresh Water farms, 
this would impact the accuracy of the weighting that the start finder places on
fresh water plots and on fresh water grasslands in particular. This is the type of
assumption built in to the system now. In a way it is unfriendly to mods, but it 
also provides a stronger support for the default rule set, and sets an example of
how the system could support mods as well, if re-calibrated successfully.

The start placement and resource distribution systems include no mechanism for
automatically detecting game rules modifications, or terrain or resource mods, 
either. So to the degree that your mod may impact the logic of start placement,
you may want to consider making adjustments to the system, to ensure that it
behaves in ways productive to your mod.

APPENDIX C - ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks go to Jon for turning me loose on this system. I had the vision for
this system as far back as the middle of vanilla Civ4 development, but I did
not get the opportunity to act on it until now. Designing, coding, testing 
and implementing my baby here have been a true pleasure. That the effort has
enabled a key element of Jon's overall vision for the game is a pride point.

Thanks to Ed Beach for his brilliant algorithm, which has enhanced the value
and performance of this system to a great degree.

Thanks to Shaun Seckman and Brian Wade for numerous instances of assistance
with Lua programming issues, and for providing the initial ports of Python to
Lua, which gave me an easy launching point for all of my tasks.

Thanks to everyone on the Civ5 development team whom I met on my visit to 
Firaxis HQ in Baltimore, who were so warm and welcoming and supportive. It
has been a joy to be part of such a positive working environment and to 
contribute to a team like this. If every gamer got to see the inside of
the studio and how things really work, I believe they would be inspired.

Thanks to all on the web team, who provided direct and indirect support. I
can't reveal any details here, but each of you knows who you are.

Finally, special thanks to my wife, Jaime, who offered advice, input,
feedback and general support throughout my design and programming effort.
