The servers should also have red lights.

> A non-humanoid robotic command unit shaped as a single vertical light-grey metal prism with a blue scanning bar across its upper front. No limbs or head, one continuous chassis. It occupies the left half of the frame. Behind it is a realistic futuristic facility with mysterious machinery, styled like a Beyond Earth leader screen.

> a menacing alien leader for the game Civilization Beyond Earth. The leader should be fully contained in and centred on the left half of the image, with no part of the leader on the right half of the image. it should look like a Japanese spider crab with tentacles, no arms or torso, with no distinctive facial or humanoid features. there should be no text on the image and the image should have a reddish brown hue

> A luminous tripedal alien growth for Civilization Beyond Earth, placed entirely on the left side. Its structure is an irregular bio-organic pillar branching into three supports, lacking arms, head, and facial traits. No text. The environment has a green cast and realistic sci-fi detail.
